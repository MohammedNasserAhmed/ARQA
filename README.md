# QA-System
The repository is for a Question and Answer System using Google's Vertex AI PaLM, LangChain, and Streamlit

To build a Question and Answering (QA) application that answers user questions based on the information available on a webpage, and also includes text summarization, pre-written Twitter tweets, and a LinkedIn post, you can follow the following workflow:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Python and necessary dependencies.
   - Install StreamLit, LangChain, and other required libraries.

2. Retrieve the webpage content:
   - Use LangChain to index and extract the text from the webpage.
   - Store the extracted text for further processing.

3. Summarize the webpage content:
   - Utilize a text summarization algorithm or library (such as GPT-3) to generate a summary of the webpage content.
   - Display the summary to provide users with an overview of the page.

4. Integrate Google's Vertex AI PaLM API:
   - Authenticate and set up access to the Vertex AI PaLM API.
   - Utilize the PaLM API to build a question-answering system that extracts information from the indexed webpage text.
   - Implement the necessary API calls to send user questions and retrieve answers based on the available information.

5. Develop the StreamLit web application:
   - Use StreamLit to create the user interface for the QA application.
   - Design the interface to include a search bar where users can enter their questions.
   - Display the answers generated by the PaLM API in a user-friendly format.

6. Incorporate pre-written Twitter tweets and LinkedIn post:
   - Create pre-written tweets and a LinkedIn post to promote the QA application.
   - Include relevant information about the application's features and benefits.
   - Share the links to the application and encourage users to try it out.

7. Test and deploy the application:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application functions as expected.
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform or server.
   - Make sure the application is accessible to users.

8. Monitor and maintain the application:
   - Regularly monitor the application's performance and user feedback.
   - Address any issues or bugs that arise.
   - Keep the application up to date with the latest versions of libraries and APIs.



## Repository Name: Q&A System with Vertex AI PaLM, LangChain, and Streamlit
### Description:
This repository contains the code and resources for building a question and answer system using Google's Vertex AI PaLM API, LangChain, and Streamlit. The system is designed to extract information from large documents and provide answers to user questions based on the available information.
### :: Features ::
* Integration with Google's Vertex AI PaLM API for question answering capabilities.
* Utilizes LangChain for indexing and extracting text from webpages or documents.
* Streamlit is used to develop the web application for a user-friendly interface.
* Includes text summarization functionality to provide an overview of the webpage content.
* Pre-written Twitter tweets and a LinkedIn post are incorporated for promotion.
###  :: Contents ::
* index.py: The main Python script that integrates the Vertex AI PaLM API, LangChain, and Streamlit to build the question and answer system.
* langchain_utils.py: A utility module that contains functions for indexing and extracting text using LangChain.
* summarization.py: A module that implements text summarization using a suitable algorithm or library.
* twitter_tweets.txt: A text file containing pre-written Twitter tweets for promoting the application.
* linkedin_post.txt: A text file containing a pre-written LinkedIn post for promoting the application.

README.md: A detailed README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.

### :: Usage ::
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the necessary dependencies and libraries.
* Set up the required API credentials for Google's Vertex AI PaLM.
* Customize the pre-written Twitter tweets and LinkedIn post to suit your needs.
* Run the index.py script to start the Streamlit web application.
